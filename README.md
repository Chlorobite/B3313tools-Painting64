# B3313 Dev Tools - Painting64
Painting64 is a B3313-specific tool that injects painting data into level geometry data.

Usage: `./Painting64 './b3313 silved.z64'`

The confirmation and exit prompts can be bypassed with the `--automatic` flag.

You must source your own target ROM & .config file pair, as well as `paintingcfg.txt`. We will not provide instructions on how to obtain this material.
